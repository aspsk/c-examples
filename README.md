# c-examples

A set of short unrelated programs written in C.  (The actual goal of this repo
is to gather short C examples scattered throughout my computers and backups.)

## The list of programs

* `directory_size/`: use openat and fstatat to compute the size of a directory (the same as `du -sb`, but slightly faster
* `flock_example/`: a simple example illustrating the `flock(2)` system call
